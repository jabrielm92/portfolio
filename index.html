        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I have a passion for figuring out and understading how things work at their core. 
          I consider myself a true creative at heart. Being able to create programs and build 
          apps turned out to be something I wished I had dove into sooner.
          Everyone has their thing. Some enjoy writing in their spare time, others like to make 
          music. I happen to be obsessed with learning!</p>

            <h4>The MINT Money App</h4>
            <p>A freelance project I'm building for a credit repair/finance company named The MINT
              Company LLC. App built using React. Login/signup, income input, and expense input all stored
              in Firebase. User has ability to add/remove both income and expenses. They can also set due 
              dates and reminders. User input is displayed as a dashboard item/card as well as a pie chart. 
              Many other features planned to be implemented, with company electing to have a standard free 
              version and a paid premium version. Take it for a spin!

            <h4>The Fitness App</h4>
            <p>A work in progress. Here I've created a simple fitness tracker app using React. 
              I implented two different API's that work hand in hand. One API searches exercises
              based on muscle group. When the user saves a searched exercises, the name of the exercise
              is then passed to the second API and used to render a gif of exercise. I used Firebase on 
              the backend to store sign up/login. Firebase is also implemented to store user's saved
              exercises. User then has option to create workout plans and track progress. Take it for a 
              spin!</p>
