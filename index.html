        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I have a passion for figuring out and understanding how things work at their core. 
          I consider myself a true creative at heart. Being able to create programs and build 
          apps turned out to be something I wished I had dove into sooner.
          Everyone has their thing. Some enjoy writing in their spare time, others like to make 
          music. I happen to be obsessed with learning!</p>

            <h4>The Fitness App</h4>
            <p>A work in progress. Here I've created a simple fitness tracker app using React. 
              I implented two different API's that work hand in hand. One API searches exercises
              based on muscle group. When the user saves a searched exercises, the name of the exercise
              is then passed to the second API and used to render a gif of exercise. I used Firebase on 
              the backend to store sign up/login. Firebase is also implemented to store user's saved
              exercises. User then has option to create workout plans and track progress. Take it for a 
              spin!</p>

            <h4>YSCTAGIAF-blog</h4>
            <p>A personal blog i'm building using Python/Flask. Consists of 2 pages 
              and a sub page so far. A blog page and an admin dashboard. 
              The admin dashboard allows for create/edit/delete posts. Posts can 
              be text, img, video, or a combination of the 3. Edit post has is own 
              page where the specific post is called to be edited.
              Feel free to test them out. Admin dash is enabled for create/edit/delete 
              for the time being until I begin to utilize personally. Just wanted to 
              show some new work. Any questions or additions or comments, feel free to 
              use the admin dash to create a post. (deployed on Render using basic 
              package | please allow time for page(s) to load)

            <h4>The MINT Money App</h4>
            <p>A freelance project I'm building for a credit repair/finance company named The MINT
              Company LLC. App built using Vue. Login/signup, income input, and expense input all stored
              in Firebase. User has ability to add/remove both income and expenses. They can also set due 
              dates and reminders as well as budget. User input is displayed as a dashboard item, transactions. 
              Data also displayed as a pie chart. Many other features planned to be implemented, with company electing to have a standard free 
              version and a paid premium version. Take it for a spin!
